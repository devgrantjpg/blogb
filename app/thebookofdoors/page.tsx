        *"Cassie Andrews works in a New York City bookshop, shelving books, making coffee for customers, and living an unassuming, ordinary life. Until the day one of her favorite customersâ€”a lonely yet charming old manâ€”dies right in front of her. Cassie is devastated. She always loved his stories, and now she has nothing to remember him by. Nothing but the last book he was reading.  

        But this is no ordinary bookâ€¦

        It is the Book of Doors. 

        Inscribed with enigmatic words and mysterious drawings, it promises Cassie that any door is every door. You just need to know how to open them.

        Then sheâ€™s approached by a gaunt stranger in a rumpled black suit with a Scottish brogue who calls himself Drummond Fox. Heâ€™s a librarian who keeps watch over a unique set of rare volumes. The tome now in Cassieâ€™s possession is not the only book with great power, but it is the one most coveted by those who collect them."*
